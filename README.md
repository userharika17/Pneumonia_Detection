# Pneumonia Detection using Deep Learning

Pneumonia is a serious respiratory infection causing high mortality worldwide. This project presents **Pneumonia Detection Network (PDN)**, a deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed for accurate detection and localization of pneumonia in chest X-ray images.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Most existing Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems rely on binary classification and lack lesion localization capabilities. Our PDN model addresses this limitation by providing both classification and visual localization of pneumonia-affected areas using Grad-CAM.

## 🚀 Features

- End-to-end CNN architecture (PDN)
- Trained on labeled chest X-ray dataset
- High accuracy and efficient performance
- Lesion localization using Grad-CAM
- Visualization of prediction results

## 🗂️ Dataset

We used the [Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) available on Kaggle. It contains:
- Normal and pneumonia-affected X-rays
- Separate folders for training, testing, and validation

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
